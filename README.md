#Welcome to module 5 assignment - Financial Planner

##Background

The first section is a personal finance planner that will allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund. The data is driven from API calls and parsed to show the portfolio balance of assets. 

The second tool is a retirement planning tool that will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years. You will then use the Monte Carlo data to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount.

The bonus rounds were to simulate different retirement years and inital investment amounts.
